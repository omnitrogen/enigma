* **Requirements**:

> - [x] You just need to have Python installed on your machine (you can install it [here](https://www.python.org/), go to Download and select the latest version of Python 3.x.x), because tkinter is a module of the standard library!



* **Command line version**: run the enigma.py file by typing <code>python enigma.py</code> in your terminal if you are a weird hacker :neckbeard: :computer: 



* **Graphical version for desktop**: run the enigma-gui.py file located under the gui folder by typing <code>python enigma-gui.py</code> :tada:



* **Graphical version for small devices**: run the enigma-gui-resizable-window.py file located under the gui folder by typing <code>python enigma-gui-resizable-window.py</code> :hatching_chick:



(you may use <code>python3</code> instead of <code>python</code>, it depends on your platform) 



Have fun! :panda_face: :bamboo:
