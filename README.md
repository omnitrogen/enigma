enigma machine python

![alt tag](https://github.com/omnitrogen/enigma/blob/master/enigma_logo_1.png)

Requirements:

>You just need to have Python installed on your machine (you can install it [here](https://www.python.org/), go to Download and select the latest version of Python 3.x.x), because tkinter is a module of the standard library!

You can find the console application by executing the <code>enigma.py</code> file if you are a weird hacker :neckbeard: :computer:

Or you can find the GUI version in the gui folder :tada:

Have fun! :panda_face:

(use it as you want, no license and other stuff...) :boom:
